## Gathering the data

When the API is queried, the response body is returned as:

{
    "files": [{
        "url": "http://auction-api-us.worldofwarcraft.com/auction-data/<key_redacted>/auctions.json",
        "lastModified": 1515623264000
    }]
}

The url is the json file generated by the query and the "lastModified" is the timestamp the data was updated. If an error message of sometime is returned, the script will sleep for 20 minutes and try again.

Since the data is approximately updated once an hour and does vary slightly on that pattern, I opted to store the timestamps in a list.  This would allow the script to check if the pulled data is new and also allow expandability of the script. If the 'lastModified' values is not in the list, the script will download the data.  If it is in the list, the script will sleep for 20 minutes and try again.  The 20 minute sleep time was chosen to keep from having massive amounts of queries per hour, but still allow multiple opportunities to retrieve the data.

When fresh data is available, the script pulls the json, appends the timestamp, and saves the file.  Since every file is pulled as "auctions.json", the naming convention of "auction<timestamp>.json" was used.  This way the timestamp is recored both in the record and the file name. The file is saved in a "data" folder for ease of file management.

Once completed, I set up an EC2 on Amazon AWS (free tier) and ran it using screen to allow for the script to run indefinitely, or at least until the EC2 is shut down/restarted.  The server was shut down a few times.  First because of an issue an email sent in error stating that the EC2 was going over its runtime (another email was sent to state that the original email was sent in error).  A second time was in light of Amazon dealing with the issues with the Intel chips.

Data was gathered for the last week or so from 2017 and has been started up again.
