### WOW Auction introduction
---
I wanted to have a learning project that would include many different types of opportunities for growth as I could.  I also play WOW and have seen many sites and apps utilize information from WOW, so I decided to make one myself.

Through some searching, I found out that Blizzard (makers of WOW) have several APIs available for public use.  One of those features auction data for individual servers.  All APIs available are located at [dev.battle.net](dev.battle.net)

## WOW

---

WOW is a MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game).  What this means is that players can interact with each other in various ways, including for this project buying and selling of items through an auction house.

The player base is seperated into servers and into one of two factions, Alliance and Horde.  Each server's auction house is linked, so players from one faction can purchase items from players of either faction.
