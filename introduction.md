### WOW Auction introduction
---
I wanted to have a learning project that would include many different types of opportunities for growth as I could.  I also play WOW and have seen many sites and apps utilize information from WOW, so I decided to make one myself.

Through some searching, I found out that Blizzard (makers of WOW) have several APIs available for public use.  One of those features auction data for individual servers.  All APIs available are located at [dev.battle.net](dev.battle.net)

## WOW

---

WOW is a MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game).  What this means is that players can interact with each other in various ways, including for this project buying and selling of items through an auction house.  The player base is separated into servers and into one of two factions, Alliance and Horde.  Each server's auction house is linked, so players from one faction can purchase items from players of either faction.  Any paying player may put up items on the auction house as well as buy items from it.

A wide variety of items may be placed on the auction house.  These include profession materials, armor, weapons, battle pets or crafted items.  Some items can not be sold to other players as they are bound to the player when they initially receive them, such as some armors and weapons.

## Why I am doing this
---
I wanted a data project that featured some skills that would be useful for other applications.  These include:
* Retriving data from an online source
* Cleaning data
* Visualizing data
* Analyzing data

I chose this data set because it is living data that is constantly being updated.  The data is used in the online economy of the server in question, it models actual economies.  Also, since each server is distinct, comparing multiple servers auction data would lead to some interesting comparisons, analogous to differing economies among distinct communities.
